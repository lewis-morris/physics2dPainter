# Physics Sandbox

## What am I?

Physics sandbox is what it says on the tin. Its a 2D physics sandbox game creator based solely on pybox2d (box2D) and 
opencv with a dash of numpy and pysimplegui (theres no pygame, its all written from scratch).

You can create any realistic simulations and game scenarios of your choosing. Think of it as a of
Gary's Mod. But not as good and only in 2D.

## Why?

This is just a project for me to improve my python skills, there are bugs. But it works pretty well for fun.

It MAY crash on you & its only tested fully in Linux (although all libraries used are cross platform)

## What can I do?

I've managed to unfaithfully create a whole host of games which you can load. 

Give them a go, and find out for your self. (If you have an engineering degree I think you might make something better
than me!!)

## How do I try it out?

If you've got git installed its easy.

just open a console or command prompt and navigate to a folder you wish to install it in.

```
git clone 'https://github.com/lewis-morris/physicsSandbox'
cd physicsSandbox
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

## I dont know what I'm doing, help!!

I've got tonnes of tutorials I've made, all video based.

## What if I find a bug or want an enhancement?

I've put in so much time to this project its time to move on, but if you find a glaring bug or have a great idea. Let 
me know. I'm not adverse to improving things. 

And if people enjoy it then why not make it better?

## I've made a great level and I want to share it.

Submit a pull request and maybe I'll add it to the repo.
