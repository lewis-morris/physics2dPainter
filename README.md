## What am I?

Physics sandbox is what it says on the tin. Its a 2D physics sandbox game creator based solely on pybox2d (box2D) and 
opencv with a dash of numpy and pysimplegui (theres no pygame, its all written from scratch).

You can create any realistic simulations and game scenarios of your choosing. Think of it as a of
Gary's Mod. But not as good and only in 2D.

## Why?

This is just a project for me to improve my python skills, there are bugs. But it works pretty well for fun, i've never
studied game development and don't really know what I'm doing. Its all come from stumbling across pybox2d.

It MAY crash on you & its only tested fully in Linux (although all libraries used are cross platform)

## What can I do?

I've managed to unfaithfully create a whole host of games which you can load. 

Give them a go, and find out for your self. (If you have an engineering degree I think you might make something better
than me!!)

## I dont know what I'm doing, help!!

I've got tonnes of tutorials I've made, all video based.

Apologies if I'm not so clear - theres a lot to cover and the best way to learn is to just try it for your self.

I suggest at minimum watching the first 3 tutorials, but you could get by with just the first one.

## How do I try it out?  (Installation Guide)

If you've got git installed its easy.

just open a console or command prompt and navigate to a folder you wish to install it in.

```
git clone 'https://github.com/lewis-morris/physicsSandbox'
cd physicsSandbox
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

## What if I find a bug or want an enhancement?

I've put in so much time to this project its time to move on, but if you find a glaring bug or have a great idea. Let 
me know. I'm not adverse to improving things. 

And if people enjoy it then why not make it better?

## I've made a great level and I want to share it.

Submit a pull request and maybe I'll add it to the repo.
